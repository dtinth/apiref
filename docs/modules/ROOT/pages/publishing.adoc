= Publishing an API reference


. Use https://api-extractor.com/[@microsoft/api-extractor] to generate a https://api-extractor.com/pages/setup/generating_docs/[doc model file]. If done correctly, you should have an `.api.json` file in your project. (You don't need to commit this file to your repository.)
. Add a `docModel` field to your `package.json` file, pointing to the `.api.json` file.
. Publish your package to npm. Make sure the package includes the `.api.json` file along with the other built files.
. You can access the API reference of your package at these URLs:
+
* `\https://apiref.page/package/{package-name}`
* `\https://apiref.page/package/{package-name}@{version}`
